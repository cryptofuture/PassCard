PassCard
================

Android Password Card Generator Application.

The idea is simple: generate a password card that has your passwords printed in the card IN PLAIN TEXT. Take the card with you, and you have access to passwords, for every account you have, and if an attacker get access to your card, you'll have time to change your password.

Application could be useful for old people, for people who need quite frequently need change passwords. Beside that fact that even printed Password Card glued to your monitor and shared in media, can be quite secure and will give you some time to change password in case of leak. Also you can invent you own scheme for reading letters on Password Card, where every letter means something else.
